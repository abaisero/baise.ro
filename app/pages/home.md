I am a PhD student at Northeastern University, where I am working under Prof.
Chris Amato on reinforcement learning in partially observable environments.

;; My research interests focus on stochastic models for pattern recognition,
;; representation learning, symbol learning and logic-geometric information
;; sharing with applications in general-purpose robotics, context-aware autonomous
;; systems, and human-robot interaction.

I am particularly interested in the notion of learning to exploit consistent
observations of the domain dynamics to optimally decrease the need for
exploration strategies in future tasks which are only marginally similar.  The
reason adult humans are so flexible in their ability to perform wide ranges of
tasks is that we have strong priors about world physics and the structure of
man-made environments.  But our priors are really posteriors that we have built
through years of supervised and unsupervised experience, during our childhood.
As humans, we are somehow able to decompose experience accumulated across long
periods of times into atomic component, and recombine them to fit new scenarios
which are, as a whole unit, novel and unique.  I believe these two aspect of
human intellect to be key contributors to our success in task-solving.

;; My goal is to design reinforcement learning algorithms which are able to learn
;; aspects of the environment and exploit whatever has been learned (in whatever
;; representation it may be) as much as possible in future tasks, i.e., to make
;; strong priors out of strong posteriors.

Alongside reinforcement learning, my other interests include stochastic models,
bayesian inference, information theory, and game theory.
