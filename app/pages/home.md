# Hi!

I'm Andrea Baisero, an aspiring researcher in the field of machine learning.

My research interests focus on stochastic models for pattern recognition,
representation learning, symbol learning and logic-geometric information
sharing with applications in general-purpose robotics, context-aware autonomous
systems, and human-robot interaction.
