In the Fall, I will be joining Prof. Chris Amato at Northeastern University as
a PhD student to work on multi-agent reinforcement learning.  Alongside
reinforcement learning, my other interests include stochastic models, bayesian
inference, information theory, and game theory.

;; My research interests focus on stochastic models for pattern recognition,
;; representation learning, symbol learning and logic-geometric information
;; sharing with applications in general-purpose robotics, context-aware autonomous
;; systems, and human-robot interaction.
