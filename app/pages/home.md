I am a PhD student at Northeastern University, where I am working under Prof.
Chris Amato on (multi-agent) reinforcement learning.  Alongside reinforcement
learning, my other interests include stochastic models, bayesian inference,
information theory, and game theory.

;; My research interests focus on stochastic models for pattern recognition,
;; representation learning, symbol learning and logic-geometric information
;; sharing with applications in general-purpose robotics, context-aware autonomous
;; systems, and human-robot interaction.
