# Research

My PhD research focuses on symbolic reasoning and the conversion between
symbolic and geometric representations of the environment.  Find [here][pubs] a

### Temporal Segmentation of Sequential Manipulation Demonstrations

I defined a motion-based graphical model which temporally segments human
demonstrations into the fundamental interaction sequences which concurrently
manifest between hand-object and object-object pairs.

The temporal segmentation can be used to autonomously break a complex
demonstration into its more basic components, and is also used on assembly
demonstrations to extract a set of transferrable instructions which abstract
the performed assembly task.

### Identification of Unmodeled Objects from Symbolic Descriptions

The ability of exchanging information about the environment is of prime
importance for the development of successful cooperative multi-purpose robots.

In this work, a model is defined to learn to identify, describe and distriguish
objects within their environment by leveraging visual and geometric cues.  The
goal is to endow the autonomous agent with the ability of understanding sparse
symbolic descriptions of previously unmodeled objects, and of generating
appropriate descriptions of its own (with the goal of human).

; ### Geometry Density Estimation

; Symbolic and motion planning are very different problems domains with almost no overlap method.

; An ideal autonomous system is able to intertrine the symbolic and motion
; planning procedures in order to formulate joint symbolic-motion plans.

; Current state of the art only mildly addresses this, while most approached
; address the problems independently and sequentially.
