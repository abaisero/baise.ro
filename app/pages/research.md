During my PhD studies, I've worked on various aspects concerning symbolic
reasoning, from symbol learning to interpretation of relational instructions.
I have worked on the following distinct topics:

 * [Decoding Relational Descriptions][rfdm]
 * [Identification of Unmodeled Objects via Relational Descriptions][iden]
 * [Temporal Segmentation of Sequential Manipulations][tseg]
