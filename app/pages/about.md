# Me

My research interests focus on stochastic models for pattern recognition,
representation learning, symbol learning and logic-geometric information
sharing with applications in general-purpose robotics, context-aware autonomous
systems, and human-robot interaction.

# My Website

This website is written using [Flask][flask], a minimalistic python framework
for static and dynamic websites and webapp development which uses the
[Jinja][jinja] templating language to build page structure and
[Markdown][markdown] to fill in content.

The style is powered by [Bootstrap][bootstrap] (an HTML/CSS/JS framework) and
[Font Awesome][fontawesome] (an icon toolkit).  Despite not being a web
developer, I was able to create this website with ease using these tools.
Layout and style are inspired by [Steve Losh][slosh] and [Data
Genetics][datagen].
