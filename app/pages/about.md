# Me

I pursued my Bachelor studies in Computer Engineering at PoliTo, in Italy.  I
continued my Master studies in Computer Engineering and Science taking part in
a double-degree program which allowed me to split my studies between PoliTo
and KTH, in Sweden.  I am currently pursuing a PhD at the MLR group at the
University of Stuttgart, in Germany.

*[PoliTo]: Polytechnic University of Turin
*[KTH]: Royal Institute of Technology
*[MLR]: Machine Learning and Robotics

# My Website

This website is written using [Flask][flask], an extremely simple python
framework for static and dynamic websites and webapp development which uses the
[Jinja][jinja] templating language to build page structure and
[Markdown][markdown] to fill in content.

The style is powered by [Bootstrap][bootstrap] (an HTML/CSS/JS framework) and
[Font Awesome][fontawesome] (an icon toolkit).  I am by no means a web
developer, and yet with these tools I managed to create this simple website
with little trouble.  Layout and style are inspired by [Steve Losh][slosh] and
[Data Genetics][datagen].

The complete source code for this site can be found on its [<i class="fa
fa-github-alt fa-lg"></i> github][github] page.
