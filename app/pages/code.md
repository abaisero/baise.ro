### RL {:#rl}

I am developing a simple reinforcement learning library as an exercise to learn
more on the subject and to solve some of the programming exercises from Sutton
and Barto's RL book.

Currently contains:  customizable state and action structures, tabular and
parametric value functions, non-parametric policies, multi-armed bandit and
Markov decision process problem structures, and an increasing amount of
solution methods:  Policy and value iteration, SARSA, Q-learning, MCTS, and
temporal difference search, with more to come.

### PyTk: Python toolkit {:#pytk}

A personal repository containing general purpose utilities including: context
managers, decorators, iterators, collections, and 3D geometry classes.

The code is in continuous fluctuation and not significantly stable but, if you
want to check it out, can be found at [<span class="icon fa

### Baise.ro {:#baise.ro}

This website is developed using [Flask][flask], a minimalistic python framework
for webapp development which uses the [Jinja][jinja] templating language to
build page structure and [Markdown][markdown] to fill in the content.  The
style is powered by [Skeleton][skeleton] (a CSS boilerplate),
[Bootstrap][bootstrap] (an HTML/CSS/JS framework), [Font Awesome][fontawesome]
(an icon toolkit), and [Font-Mfizz][fontmfizz] (a complementary icon toolkit).
Despite not being a web developer, these tools allowed me to create this
website with fun and ease.

The complete source code is available on its [<span class="icon fa
fa-github-alt fa-lg"></span> github][baise.ro] page.

; ### PyFGraph

; While working on my PhD, I found myself in the need for a simple but highly
; flexible graphical model library for python.  I ended up writing my own code
; which has now become a side-project of its own.  The library is called PyFGraph
; and you can find the source code on its [<span class="icon fa fa-github-alt
; fa-lg"></span> github][github] page.

; The code is still very primitive and in a fundamentally unorderly state, and
; will hardly be of any use to anyone else but me, at its current stage.
; Nevertheless, I plan to keep working on it to make it a viable tools for others
; as well.

; The final goal which I have in mind is not to compete with other libraries in
; terms of code and algorithm efficiency.  Rather, I plan on preserving the
; original spirit of the code and develop it to compete in terms of the
; flexibility with which factor graphs can be defined and used.
