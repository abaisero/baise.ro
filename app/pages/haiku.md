# Haiku

.haiku
Oh how I dearly
long to grow.  I look out, and
the tree within grows.

.haiku
Sure, you once were sure;
and future bright and obvious.
Get up and endure.

.haiku
A most honest wish.
I hope you do not desire
what you can't achieve.

.haiku
You've planned the journey,
You want the prize. So what now?
Where is your first step?

.haiku
Days, weeks, months or years.
Which discount factor best leads
to real fulfillment?
