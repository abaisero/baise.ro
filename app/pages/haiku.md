# Haiku

.haiku
Oh how I dearly
long to grow.  I look out, and
the tree within grows.

.haiku
Sure, you once were sure;
and future bright and obvious.
Get up and endure.

; .haiku
; A most honest wish.
; I hope, may you not desire
; what you can't achieve.

.haiku
Days, weeks, months or years.
How much to wait for real joy?
How to discount life?

## From [r/haiku][haikusub]

.haiku
Hungry lambs cry out.
Sometimes the mother attends,
and sometimes the wolf.

.haiku
As the seasons pass,
do not be sad they are gone.
We used them to grow.
