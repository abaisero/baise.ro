;; .haiku
;; Oh how I dearly
;; long to grow.  I look out, and
;; the tree within grows.

.haiku
Sure, you once were sure;
and future bright and obvious.
Get up and endure.

;; .haiku
;; A most honest wish.
;; I hope, may you not desire
;; what you can't achieve.

;; .haiku
;; Step by step by step,
;; I persevere 'cause I trust
;; that small things matter.

;; .haiku
;; Days, weeks, months or years.
;; How much to wait for real joy?
;; How to discount life?

.haiku
To climb mount Fuji
more than once or not even
is man's biggest fear.

.haiku
Hungry lambs cry out.
Sometimes the mother attends,
and sometimes the wolf.

.haiku
As the seasons pass,
do not be sad they are gone.
We used them to grow.

.haiku
Cross a river twice
and the river meets two men;
and you, two rivers.

.haiku
All good things end;
in gaining a lover
I've lost a good friend.
