title: Predictive Internal State Models

Sequential decision making under partial observability depends on the ability
to aggregate past observations into a concise and informative internal state
(istate) based on which present and future decisions can be made.

The ideal istate representation:

* is concise
* is informative
* satisfies the Markov property

an internal
state representation to aggregate previous events into a concise and
informative internal state. 

;; At any given time, autonomous agents

;; For autonomous agents to operate under partial observability, an internal state
