At the Computer Vision and Active Perception (CVAP) lab, I worked on my MSc
thesis on the topic of kernel functions for sequential data.  The main result
of this research has been the development of a novel and theoretically sound
kernel function&mdash;the Path Kernel&mdash;for discrete and finite sequences
of arbitrary symbols.

Given a lexicon $\Sigma$ and strings $s, t \in \Sigma^+$, the Path Kernel
$k_\texttt{PATH}$ computes a general measure of similarity which is
interpretable in terms of the number of matching substrings, their length and
their location.  $k_\texttt{PATH}$ is agnostic with respect to the nature of
the lexicon, and depends numerically on a freely chosen Symbol Kernel
$k_\Sigma\colon \Sigma\times\Sigma\to\mathbb{R}$ which is valid for the lexicon
$\Sigma$, and through which context and prior knowledge about the application
domain can be embedded.
