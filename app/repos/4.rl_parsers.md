title: rl_parsers - Reinforcement Learning Parsers
repo_name: abaisero/rl_parsers
repo_url: https://github.com/abaisero/rl_parsers


Stand-alone repository containing parsers for files related to RL.  Currently
contains parsers for the standard .POMDP and .DPOMDP formats, as well as custom
.FSC (Finite State Controller) and .FSS (Finite State Structure) formats which
I use for my own research.
