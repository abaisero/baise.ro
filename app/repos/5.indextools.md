repo_name: abaisero/indextools
repo_url: https://github.com/abaisero/indextools


Family of classes which represent bijections between sets of $N$ structured
and/or semantic values/objects and a corresponding set of indices $\{0, \ldots,
N-1\}$;  Useful to represent and access tables of values indexed directly by
objects with rich interfaces and attributes.  

The provided classes automate (via a user-friendly interface) the conversions
between values and indices.
