A simple reinforcement learning library as an exercise to learn more on the
subject and to solve the programming exercises from Sutton and Barto's RL book.

Currently contains:  customizable state and action structures, tabular and
parametric value functions, non-parametric policies, multi-armed bandit and
Markov decision process problem structures, and an increasing amount of
solution methods:  Policy and value iteration, SARSA, Q-learning, MCTS, and
temporal difference search, with more to come.
