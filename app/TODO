 * check that file is actually an image
 * write program which loads files in local directory and visualizes them (maybe some frames are already programmable that way)
 * decide whether to keep the files in server or to remove them and only store them locally


 * choose a json representation for user and pix
 * do authentication stuff
   * create fake service to verify this
 * password recovery


 BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
  * define your resources and access rights better!!!!!!!!!
