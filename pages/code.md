# PyFGraph

While working on my PhD, I found myself in the need for a simple but highly
flexible graphical model library for python.  I ended up writing my own code
which has now become a side-project of its own.  The library is called PyFGraph
and you can find the source code on its [<i class="fa fa-github-alt fa-lg"></i>
github][github] page.

The code is still very primitive and in a fundamentally unorderly state, and
will hardly be of any use to anyone else but me, at its current stage.
Nevertheless, I plan to keep working on it to make it a viable tools for others
as well.

The final goal which I have in mind is not to compete with other libraries in
terms of code and algorithm efficiency.  Rather, I plan on preserving the
original spirit of the code and develop it to compete in terms of the
flexibility with which factor graphs can be defined and used.
