# Research

My PhD research focuses on symbol learning and learning abstract task
representations from human demonstration.  Although I don't currently work with
it, the field of reinforcement learning interests me highly, so I hope to find
a way to include it in my work at some point.  Find [here][publications] a list
of my publications.

### Temporal Segmentation of Sequential Manipulation Demonstrations

I defined a motion-based graphical model which temporally segments human
demonstrations into the fundamental interaction sequences which concurrently
manifest between hand-object and object-object pairs.

The temporal segmentation can be used to autonomously break a complex
demonstration into its more basic components, and is also used on assembly
demonstrations to extract a set of transferrable instructions which abstract
the performed assembly task.

### Symbolic Language for Object Description

I'm currently developing models which learns to identify, describe and
distinguish objects within their environment by leveraging visual and geometric
properties.  The objective is to achieve an autonomous system which is able to
communicate with a human agent about objects using sparse descriptions which
are sufficient for the purpose of identification.
