# # Research

My research interests are planning, semantical scene understanding, symbol
learning, and reinforcement learning.

In my PhD, I've been using motion analysis to learn from human-performed
manipulative demonstrations.  So far I have worked on models to temporally
segment the demonstration, and to extract a set of transferrable instructions
which abstract the performed actions.  Most likely, I will soon start working
on learning a symbolic language through which to represent the environment
during planning tasks whose goal is to reproduce similar manipulations as the
ones being showcased.
