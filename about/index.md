# Me

I pursued my Bachelor studies in Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic
University of Turin (PoliTo), in Italy.

I pursued my Master studies in Computer Engineering and Science within the
context of a double-degree program at the PoliTo and the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH), in Sweden.

I am currently pursuing a PhD at the Machine Learning and Robotics (MLR) group
at the University of Stuttgart, in Germany.

# My Website

This website was developed using [Jekyll][jekyll], a static site generator
which uses the [Liquid][liquid] templating language to build page structure and
[Markdown][markdown] to fill in content.  The style is powered by
[Bootstrap][bootstrap] (an HTML/CSS/JS framework) and [Font
Awesome][fontawesome] (an icon toolkit).  I am by no means a web developer, and
yet with these tools I managed to create this handy website with ease and
peace.  Layout and style are inspired by [Steve Losh][slosh] and [Data
Genetics][datagen].

You can find the complete source for this site on its [<i class="fa
fa-github-alt fa-lg"></i> github][github] page.
