# PyFGraph

While working on my PhD, I found myself in the need for a flexible graphical
model library.  Alas, I couldn't find any toolkit which fitted my requirements,
and ended up writing my own code which has now become a side-project of its
own.  I've named the project [PyFGraph][pyfgraph], since the main component is
a Factor Graph.

The code is still very primitive and in a fundamentally unorderly state.  At
the current stage, it will hardly be of any use to anyone but me.
Nevertheless, I do feel that it has the potential to fill a tiny gap in what is
currently available, so I plan to keep on working on it.

The final goal which I have in mind is not to compete with other toolkits in
terms of efficiency and number of nodes which can be handled.  Rather, I plan
on preserving the original spirit of the code and develop it to compete in
terms of the flexibility with which factor graphs can be created, trained and
used.
